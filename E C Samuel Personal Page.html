            <p>Welcome to my newly redesigned website. After seeing the amount of inline coding I had done in the previous week, it felt more sensible to start from scratch, both for practice sake as well as for cleanliness. I will be using elements of this page as the foundtion for a "virtual resume" as well.</p>
